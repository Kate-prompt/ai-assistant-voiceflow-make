# AI Assistant Workflow Description ðŸš€  

## Overview  
This document describes the workflow of the AI-powered assistant built using OpenAI Playground, Voiceflow, and Make.com. The assistant collects customer information and automates the process of storing and notifying relevant parties.  

## Step-by-Step Workflow  

### 1 User Interaction with AI Assistant  
- The user visits the website and interacts with the AI assistant embedded via **Voiceflow**.  
- The assistant welcomes the user and asks for essential details:  
  - **Name**  
  - **Service Type**  
  - **Preferred Date & Time**  
  - **Location**  

### 2 Data Processing via Make.com  
- The collected data is sent from **Voiceflow to Make.com** via a webhook.  
- Make.com processes the data and:  
  - **Stores it in a Google Sheet** for record-keeping.  
  - **Sends a notification to a Telegram group** with the user's request.  

### 3 Automated Notifications  
- The assistant ensures that new customer requests are automatically pushed to a **Telegram group** using the **Telegram Bot API**.  
- This allows the business to receive and manage incoming requests efficiently.
